Models
======

The models we will consider are descriptions of stochastic processes
:math:`\{y_t\}` that can be put in the form of a linear state space model with
Gaussian irregular components.

Although there are a large number of models (and even often several ways to
represent a given model in state-space form), much can be accomplished simply
by combining a few important models:

- The **basic structural time series model**
